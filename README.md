# Hire4Good Frontend

This frontend project is built with NextJS and Typescript.

The goal of this web application is to bridge the gap for kidney patients seeking employment by connecting them with potential employers.

The application enables employers to communicate with potential employees and access educational resources pertaining to kidney disease, promoting empathy and understanding for the unique challenges faced by kidney patients.

On the other hand, kidney patients can leverage the resources section to further develop their skills and reach out to employers by showcasing their profile. They may share their contact information, such as their email or LinkedIn profile, to facilitate communication with potential employers and open up job opportunities.
